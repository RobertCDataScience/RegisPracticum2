StockX Data: TThis Data Comes from StockX. It was a part of an open-source contest the company held back in 2019.
StockX is a secondary market for athletic shoes, apparel, and technology that is in high demand. The data has about 100,000 rows of data with 7 columns, Order Date, Brand, Sneaker Name, Sale Price, Retail Price, Shoe Size, and the region it was sold in.


As far as cleaning the data there wasn't much to clean. The data came in pretty good condition. There weren't any null fields or missing data. The only thing that I adjusted was the column names.I adjusted them just to make it easy to reference when building out models.

Modleing: I choose to use Linear, Anova, and Decision Tree for the data. I chose these models because they were straight forward and I felt it fit better with what I was trying to predict in sales data. Using linear regression I was able to find sinificant fields to predicting sale price. The decison tree showed that retail price was a strong preditor. The last model I did, I predicted if a shoe could be considered high sale price or not high sale price. With that I was ble to accurately predict 42% of the time high sale price.
